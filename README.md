- Track your reports and get real-time notifications

### For Municipalities (Admin Portal)
- Secure staff login
- Centralized dashboard of all reports
- Interactive map of issues
- Filter, sort, and manage reports
- Update status and communicate with citizens

**Stay tuned for our amazing app launch!**
